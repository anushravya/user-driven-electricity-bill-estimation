  # Part 1: Power Sources in India
  part1_text = '''
  ## <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #3366ff; font-size: 24px;">Part 1: Power Sources in India</span>
  
  India relies on a diverse mix of power sources to meet its electricity demands. The major power sources in India include:
  
  1. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ff3300; font-size: 18px;">Thermal Power</span>: Thermal power plants primarily use coal as a fuel source to generate electricity. They contribute a significant portion of India's power generation but also contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
  
  2. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #33cc33; font-size: 18px;">Wind Power</span>: India has vast wind energy potential, and wind power has been harnessed through wind turbines installed in various regions. It is a clean and renewable energy source.
  
  3. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ff9900; font-size: 18px;">Solar Power</span>: With abundant sunlight, India has seen rapid growth in solar power installations. Solar panels capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, making it a clean and sustainable energy option.
  
  4. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ffcc99; font-size: 18px;">Hydropower</span>: Hydropower plants utilize the energy of flowing water to generate electricity. India has several large and small hydropower projects, offering a reliable and renewable energy source.
  
  5. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #990099; font-size: 18px;">Biomass/Others</span>: Biomass power plants use organic matter, such as agricultural residues and municipal waste, to produce electricity. It helps in waste management and utilizes renewable resources.
  
  6. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #cc33cc; font-size: 18px;">Nuclear Power</span>: Nuclear power plants generate electricity through nuclear fission. Nuclear energy provides a significant share of India's electricity and contributes to a low-carbon energy mix.

  # Part 2: Reasons to Reduce Power Consumption
  part2_text = '''
  ## <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #3366ff; font-size: 24px;">Part 2: Reasons to Reduce Power Consumption</span>
  
  While these power sources contribute to meeting India's growing energy demands, it is crucial to reduce power consumption for several reasons:
  
  1. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ff9900; font-size: 18px;">Environmental Impact</span>: Energy production, especially from fossil fuels, contributes to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. By reducing power consumption, we can minimize these environmental impacts and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.
  
  2. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ff3300; font-size: 18px;">Conservation of Resources</span>: Power generation requires the utilization of natural resources such as coal, oil, and gas. By reducing power consumption, we can conserve these finite resources and ensure their availability for future generations.
  
  3. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #cc33cc; font-size: 18px;">Cost Savings</span>: Reducing power consumption can lead to lower electricity bills for individuals, businesses, and industries. Energy-efficient practices and technologies help save money and increase financial sustainability.
  
  4. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #33cc33; font-size: 18px;">Energy Security</span>: By reducing power consumption, we can reduce our dependence on imported energy sources and enhance energy security. This can be achieved through energy conservation measures and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.
  
  5. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #990099; font-size: 18px;">Sustainable Development</span>: Reducing power consumption aligns with the goal of sustainable development. It helps in achieving a balance between economic growth, social well-being, and environmental protection, ensuring a better future for generations to come.
  
  To achieve these objectives, it is essential to promote energy conservation and efficiency measures, adopt renewable energy technologies, raise awareness about power consumption patterns, and encourage responsible energy consumption habits at the individual, community, and national levels.
